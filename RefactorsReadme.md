# Challenge-Week-1

In thus challenge we have been asked to make our website more accessible
The changes I have done are as follows

## Title
I have changed the title from just website to Horiseon. I was going to put "Horiseon website" but it was a bit long and was not fully visible so I just left it as the name of the company.

## Add alt attribute to images icons
I have added the alt attribute for all the images and icons so that they can be accessible-friebdly

## Addded semantic elements
I added header, main section and footer tags to make the html doc more readable

## Check the links and add id to the first link
Of the three links two of them are pointing to the relevant areas in the page but one of them is not
The other two elemenets has id tags and they have # to locate element
But the first one did not have id attribute so I added one and it also points to the correct element when clicked

## Move the html to root directory and refactor the image links
For the HTML page to be displayed in the pages section in github it needs to be moved to 
root directory. I moved the file to the root file but for ot to work as expected the realtive path 
for images and icons also need to be updated hence I updated the location paths for images.
