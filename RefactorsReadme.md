# Challenge-Week-1

In thus challenge we have been asked to make our website more accessible
The changes I have done are as follows

## Title
I have changed the title from just website to Horiseon. I was going to put "Horiseon website" but it was a bit long and was not fully visible so I just left it as the name of the company.

## Add alt attribute to images icons
I have added the alt attribute for all the images and icons so that they can be accessible-friebdly

## Addded semantic elements
I added header, main section and footer tags to make the html doc more readable

## Move the html to root directory and refactor the image links
For the HTML page to be displayed in the pages section in github it needs to be moved to 
root directory. I moved the file to the root file but for ot to work as expected the realtive path 
for images and icons also need to be updated hence I updated the location paths for images.
